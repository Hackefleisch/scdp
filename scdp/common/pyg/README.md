# Trimmed-down `pytorch_geometric` (pyg)

We follow the same approach to [NequIP](https://github.com/mir-group/nequip/tree/main/nequip) and [MACE](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace) on using a subset of the `pyg` code.

We are grateful to the developers of PyTorch Geometric for their ongoing and very useful work on graph learning with PyTorch.
